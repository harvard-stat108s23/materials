```


**Step 1**: Create a version control `R` package.  

+ There are a couple of ways to do this step.  For this demo and Project 2, we are going to clone a starter repo from GitHub.
+ In the future, you should consider using `usethis::create_package()`.

**Step 2**: Create a version control RStudio Project with the same name as the GitHub repo.

+ Should now have a **Git** pane and a **Build** pane in the upper-right window of your RStudio session.
    * Restart your `R` Session if either is missing.

**Step 3**: If you want to include data in the package, add the raw data and wrangle it into the version the package will share.

+ Run `usethis::use_data_raw()` to create a `data-raw` folder and the `DATASET.R` file.
+ Add the raw data files to the `data-raw` folder.
+ Use the file `DATASET.R` to load and wrangle the raw data.
    + Instead of loading packages with `library(package_name)`, use `package_name::function_name()`.
    + At the bottom, include the following code to create a tidy `.Rda` file:
    
```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_data(insert_data_name, overwrite = TRUE)
```

+ Run the code in `DATASET.R` to create a new folder called `data` that contains the tidy data.
+ Run `usethis::use_r("insert_data_name")` to create a blank script file.  
    + We will add the data codebook to this file in Step 5.

**Step 4**: Add your functions to the `R` folder.

+  For each user-facing function in your package, run `usethis::use_r("insert_function_name")` to create a new script file.
+  Within each function, instead of loading packages with `library(package_name)`, use `package_name::function_name()`.
+  For any packages your functions depends on, run `usethis::use_package("package_name")`.

**Step 5**: Create documentation.

+ For each of your **function** scripts in the `R` folder, add some template documentation code by going to `Code > Insert roxygen skeleton`.
+ For each of your **data** scripts, you will need to write it from scratch. 
    + Mimic examples! 
    + Make sure to include `@format` and `@source`.
    + Include the dataset name in quotes at the bottom of the script.
+ Add [`roxygen`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html) comments that document your function or dataset.
    + Here's a [data example](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/blob/master/R/penguins.R).
    + Here's a [function example](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext/blob/main/R/bind_tf_idf.R).
    + See the [Object Documentation Chapter](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html) of [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) for more information on the syntax.
* To create the output help files, run `devtools::document()`.
    + Notice that there is now a man folder with `Rd` help files.


**Step 6**: Test drive your package functions.

* Restart your R Session and run `devtools::load_all()` to make the package functions and data available.
* Test out the functions.
    + Return to earlier steps if you find any bugs.
+ Type `?insert_function_name` or `?insert_data_name` to make sure the help file pops up and to see if it is formatted correctly.
    
**Step 7**: Run a more formal check of your package with `devtools::check(document = FALSE)`.

- Fix any errors or warnings.  (Note: The package will still compile when there are warnings and notes.)

**Step 8**: Try installing the package with `devtools::install()`.

**Step Often**: Commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository. 

**Steps to Come**: 

* Package metadata
    + DESCRIPTION
    + NAMESPACE
    + License
* Documentation
    + Best practices for the help files
    + Vignettes
    + Effective Readme
    + Website
* Testing
* Deleting or ignoring extraneous files
